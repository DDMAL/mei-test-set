Usually clefs for both staves in a part are encoded in a single
attribute element at the start of a part.  However, it is also
possible to find the clef for each staff in the part encoded in
separate attribute elements.  This example shows a case where
the attributes for the second staff are placed in the middle
of the measure element before the start of the data for the
second staff.

Files:

clef.xml	== Example case of non-contiguous attributes.
clef.mei	== Conversion to MEI.
clef-alt.xml	== More common encoding of attributes for part.
