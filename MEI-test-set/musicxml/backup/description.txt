This is a sample case of a backup element which goes backwards
past the start of a measure.  The second measure has a
duration of 1.5 quarter notes, but the backup to place the 
bottom staff notes moves backwards 2 quarter notes.  In such
cases, the backup duration should be truncated to the beginning
of the measure in which is occurs.
